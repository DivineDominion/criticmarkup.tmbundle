# Example Text

But of course CriticMarkup works:

> Don't go around saying{-- to people that--} the world owes you a living. The  world owes you nothing. It was here first. {~~One~>Only one~~} thing is impossible for God: To find {++any++} sense in any copyright law on the planet. {{Truth is stranger than fiction}}{>>true<<}, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isnâ€™t.
